## Basic Game Engine Demo

This is a recreation of my midterm project for CS 381 [Game Engine Architecture] at UNR. A basic game engine demo in which the user can select between a few different entities, and control them independently

CONTROLS:
Tab - Select next entity
Arrow Up/Down Numpad 8/2- Increase/decrease desired speed
Arrow Left/Right Numpad 4/6- Modify desired heading
Space- Stop the selected entity
W/S- Move camera forward/backward
LShift + W/S - Pitch camera up/down
A/D - Move camera left/right
LShift + A/D - Yaw camera left/right
E/F - Move camera up/down
Escape - Exit the program
