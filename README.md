# OGRE-Projects
A repo for some personal projects built in OGRE through C++

# Dependencies, Building, and Running
All projects were developed in a Linux environment and compiled in CMake. Any further project-specific dependencies will be listed in their respective folders.

### Ogre
I recommend following this [guide to building OGRE](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/building-ogre.html), and installing all recommended dependencies.

### Cmake
CMake can be downloaded at [cmake.org](cmake.org)

## Building the projects through CMake
In each case, the project can be built with the following terminal instructions

- Linux Terminal:
```
~Navigate to the project folder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./ProjectNameHere
```
